Chorégraphie
============

An open source AngularJS app to watch and understand the behavior of applications hosted in a datacenter. Can be used alone or alongside Kibana.

This NodeJS application can be connected to ElasticSearch, MongoDB or any RDBMS by a module system.

#Purpose:

Chorégraphie's goal is to:

-  untangle the call's web between your applications
-  plot an history of their values
-  warn you when an the behaviour of an application has changed

You have the charge of managing a lot of applications in a complex structure. Understanding the behavior of this web takes you too much time? Chorégraphie, pronounced /kɔʀegʀafi/, takes JSON as input and give you a set of diagrams and charts allowing you to understand how things works.
